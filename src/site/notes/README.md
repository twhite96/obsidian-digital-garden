Hey! 👋🏽 This is a *[Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/)* to collect knowledge on different web development topics so I can be not just a competent engineer but a *good* one.

Not only that, but I plan to put *all* my relevant notes here, some will remain private, however.

Here you'll find notes from different courses, blog posts, and books I've read on the topic of React, web development, JavaScript, API design, and backend engineering, perhaps maybe even a little *DevOps*.

You can also find Tweets, book notes, article notes from Matter.app, improving my health and wellness, math endeavors, and anything else I find interesting.

You can jump around the site using the *Wiki links* below.
